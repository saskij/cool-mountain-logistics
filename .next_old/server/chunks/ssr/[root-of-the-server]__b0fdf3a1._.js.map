We are not a motor carrier, nor do we represent ourselves as a motor carrier. All physical transportation is provided by independent, third-party motor carriers.\n                        </p>\n\n                        <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>\n                        <p>\n                            Users of our website agree to provide accurate and truthful information when requesting rate quotes, submitting carrier onboarding packets, or tracking shipments.\n                        </p>\n\n                        <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>\n                        <p>\n                            While we stringently vet the carriers in our network, Cool Mountain Logistics LLC is not directly liable for cargo loss, damage, or delay during transit caused by third-party motor carriers, acts of God/force majeure, or shipper packaging. Claims must be filed directly against the carrier's cargo liability policy per typical brokerage indemnification.\n                        </p>\n\n                        <h3>Governing Law</h3>\n                        <p>\n                            These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Idaho and applicable federal regulations established by the FMCSA and the Department of Transportation.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"qVAAe,SAAS,IACpB,MACI,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,IAAA,EAAA,EAAA,QAAA,CAAA,WACI,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,UAAA,CAAQ,UAAU,qCACf,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,IAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,+DACX,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,CAAG,UAAU,mEAA0D,qBACxE,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,2BAAkB,yCAIvC,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,UAAA,CAAQ,UAAU,0BACf,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,kDACX,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,IAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,2CACX,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,UAAE,mKAIH,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,UAAG,sCACJ,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,UAAE,uQAIH,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,UAAG,0BACJ,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,UAAE,uKAIH,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,UAAG,4BACJ,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,UAAE,sWAIH,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,UAAG,kBACJ,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,UAAE,0KAQ3B"}
